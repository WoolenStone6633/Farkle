# Farkle
A simplified software version of Farkle where players take turns to reach a score of 10,000.

## Key Features
- Intuitive interface
- There is no player cap, only hardware limitations
- Scoring is mostly the same as the original dice game: (there is currently no minimum requirement for a player's score before the program starts tracking it)
- Scoring is displayed at the end of a player's turn
- The winner will be announced when a score of 10,000 is reached

## How To Play
You will first need to decide how many people are playing. From there, player 1 will take their turn. Select the die you wish you keep. The program will let you know if you selected a die you cannot keep. Keep rolling till you Farkle or decide to stop. At the end of each turn, the player's total score will be shown. Then it's the next player's turn.
